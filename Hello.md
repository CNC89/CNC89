**Hello World! or at least, Hello to the GitHub World!**
- 👋 Hi, I’m @CNC89, or just call me Cam :)

- 🎓 As I write this, I'm actually in a busy time of my life. My undergraduate thesis defense is coming soon, so I'm currently finishing up my manuscript and will be processing clearances to defend in under a month! 

- 👀 I’m interested in solving problems related to chemistry and the life sciences using computational tools such as Molecular Dynamics Simulations, Docking, and Network Analysis
- 📖 My undergraduate thesis is about the structural and energetic network analysis of an important enzyme in the body, GPx4. GPx4 is a notable modulator of a number of diseases such as neurodegenerative disease and cancer, and better characterizing its mechanisms may lead to new perspectives regarding therapies for these diseases :)

- 🌱 I’m currently focusing on my thesis, but will be deep diving into bioinformatics soon

- 💞️ I’m currently figuring out GitHub and collaborations in general, so I'm not too open to big projects for the time being 

- 📫 Contact me through GitHub for now
